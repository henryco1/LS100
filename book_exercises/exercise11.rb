My favorite online documentation is https://ruby-doc.org/ as it has a lot of information 
on the object you are interested in. I like how many of the object pages begin with a 
simple description of the object and how it can be used. I also like ri which is like
the man command in Linux. The ri workflow is similiar to something I am already comfortable
with. Furthermore, I like the simplicity of the ri documentation. However, ri would not be
useful for searching for a function one wants to use.
